### Hey, everyone ðŸ‘‹

I'm Luiz, a self-taught developer from Brazil who's passionate about mobile and web development, particularly in Kotlin and TypeScript. In my free time, I also like contributing to open source projects and learning about digital design and electronics.

- ðŸ”­ Currently, Iâ€™m working on [**KotlinNBT**](https://www.github.com/luizrcs/KotlinNBT) as a side project. It is a library for working with NBT data in Kotlin, with [kotlinx.serialization](https://www.github.com/Kotlin/kotlinx.serialization) support.
- ðŸŒ± Aside from programming, I'm also learning about microcontrollers (like ESP8266 and ESP32) and electronics to develop a fully automated train model. I think about it as a hobby, and I really want it to turn into something cool!
- ðŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on projects that aim to help people do their daily tasks more efficiently and simplify complicated processes. And of course, I'm also interested in contributing to open source projects that use Kotlin and TypeScript.
- ðŸ’¬ If you have any programming-related questions or ideas for new projects, feel free to ask! I love helping to plan and develop new projects, and I'm always open to new ideas.

- âš¡ Fun fact: I listen to a lot of music while programming. EDM is my favorite genre, and I find it helps me focus and keep up the rhythm!
